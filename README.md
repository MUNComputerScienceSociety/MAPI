Memorial University API
=======================

I present to you a programmatic way to access various [Memorial University](http://www.mun.ca) web offerings. On top of this API we can build things.

The vision
----------

MUN offers its students a lot of services via the internet. Some of these most people know about and use everyday, others are rather obscure and/or hard to find and use. Imagine if we had a way to organize and access the data that is available via these services in a programmatic way.

### What does this mean for developers?

It means that you can build cool things.

### What does this mean for students?

Better apps and services from people who understand the frustrations of using what MUN offers. You know that "feedback" section of the god-awful my.mun.ca Portal-thingy? Now there is a way to actually have those things implemented.

What services are we talking about?
